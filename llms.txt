# `{sdmclimateforecasts}`

## Overview

[sdmclimateforecasts](https://github.com/JessicaBolin/sdmclimateforecasts)
began as part of NOAA Fisheries’ Changing Ecosystems and Fisheries
Initiative (CEFI) and is a collaboration of code and modeling among
researchers at NOAA, University of California Santa Cruz and Davis, and
University of Washington.

Our OBJECTIVE is to produce a framework to evaluate and communicate
skill of forecast models that integrate ecological processes for use in
operational ecosystem-based fisheries management. The code in this
repository supports the production of species distribution models (SDMs)
with the intent of creating forecast products for three spatial case
study applications:

- An index of anchovy availability to support evaluations of California
  sea lion breeding success in the Southern California Bight (see Fennie
  et al. 2023 for details)
- A habitat model of swordfish distribution based on West Coast drift
  gillnet fishery catches
- An index of risk of Pacific sardine bycatch in the Pacific mackerel
  fishery

Our AIMS are to:

- Assess the forecast skill of SDMs using NOAA’s Physical Sciences
  Laboratory MOM6 and other oceanographic products
- Create a generalized skill assessment framework for use within the
  West Coast CEFI Decision Support Team and beyond
- Communicate confidence in forecast model products at various
  spatiotemporal scales
